# Nepal-Electricity-Authority
The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) was established on August 16, 1985, under the Nepal Electricity Authority Act, 1984, by merging several electricity-related organizations. This integration was necessary to eliminate duplication, improve coordination, enhance efficiency, and ensure reliable electricity supply across Nepal.
